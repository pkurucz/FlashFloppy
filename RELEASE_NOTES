   on. ADF images are also supported.
 - Operate with no HXCSDFE.CFG! Buttons will cycle through all valid
   images in the USB root folder.
 - Step-pulse speaker is supported on output JB. Recommend buffering
   through an NPN transistor unless using a piezo speaker (high
   resistance).
 - Long filenames scroll on the 1602 LCD
 - LCD backlight timer, scroll speed, and step speaker volume all
   configured via HXCSDFE.CFG (when available)
 - Hack workaround for X-Copy problems. Verified writes/copies are now
   reliable!

** v0.2.1a - 26 July 2017
** Fixes for LCD handling
 - More reliable startup
 - Fix crashes and deadlocks in operation
 - More efficient command transmission (one I2C transaction for
   successive commands)
 - Support 0x38-0x3F I2C addresses

** v0.2.a - 25 July 2017
** 1602 LCD + Drive Logic Fixes
 - 1602 LCD handling: Will recognise a 1602 LCD with "I2C backpack" as
   used (and connected) for the usual "HxC LCD mod". Does not yet
   scroll long filenames, this will be added shortly.
 - Drive Logic: Will now play nicely in multi-drive systems and make
   AmigaDOS much less confused (no more DF1-3:BAD type messages!)
 - The bootloader is also modified to talk to the 1602 LCD: if you
   want this feature then you must also update the bootloader by doing
   a full serial or USB/DFU flash of the main HEX file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

** v0.1a - 21 July 2017
** Initial release
 - Works only as sole drive in a host system (eg disconnect external
   drives!)
